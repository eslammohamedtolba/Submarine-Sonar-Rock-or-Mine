# Submarine-Sonar-Rock-or-Mine-Model
This repository contains a machine learning model trained on the Sonar dataset to classify underwater objects as either "mines" or "rocks" with an accuracy of 85%. 
This README file provides an overview of the code and its usage.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which consists of sonar signals bounced off different objects in the water.
It contains various features extracted from the sonar signals, and the target variable is binary, representing whether the object is a "mine" (M) or a "rock" (R).

## Code Overview
The code is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:
numpy for numerical operations
pandas for data manipulation
sklearn for machine learning tasks

## Here's a brief overview of the code:

### Loading and Exploring Data:
The dataset is loaded from the "sonar.csv" file into a Pandas DataFrame.
The first few rows of the dataset are printed.
Information about the dataset's shape and statistics are displayed.

### Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is divided into features (X) and the target variable (Y).
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

### Model Training:
A logistic regression model is created using LogisticRegression() from sklearn.
The model is trained on the training data using fit().

### Model Evaluation:
The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing datasets.
The accuracy scores are printed to the console.

### Making Predictions:
A sample input data point is provided to demonstrate how to use the trained model to make predictions.

## Usage
To use this code for your own purposes, follow these steps:
1- Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone <repository_url>
2- Ensure you have the required libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn) installed. You can install them using pip: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
3- Place your own dataset in a CSV file (e.g., "sonar.csv") or modify the code to load your dataset.
4- Modify the code as needed to suit your dataset and classification task.
5- Run the code to train and evaluate your machine learning model.
6- You can also use the trained model to make predictions for new data by providing input data similar to the "input_data" example in the code.
